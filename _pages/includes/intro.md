# üëè About Me

My name is Zhixia Fan and I am currently working as an engineer at Inner Mongolia Zhongkai Construction Engineering Co., Ltd., China.

My main research interest is the use of artificial intelligence technology to address complex problems in engineering, such as equipment prognosis and health management (PHM), energy prediction, and defect detection. Specifically, I am developing signal processing, machine learning, or deep learning methods for fault diagnosis and remaining useful life prediction of centrifugal fans, turbine rotors, wind turbine gearboxes, bearings, and other equipment in power plants; Constructing intelligent methods for predicting wind speed and wind power; Using computer vision technology for defect detection of wind turbine blades and solar panels üòä.

üí• Currently, I tend to study the compatibility between traditional signal processing and deep learning, considering using professional domain knowledge to guide the convergence of deep neural networks. Meanwhile, I am also interested in algorithms in the field of AI for Science, such as PINN and Neural Operator üòÑ.

I graduated from the School of Energy, Power, and Mechanical Engineering at North China Electric Power University (NCEPU) with a Master's degree, under the guidance of professors <span style="color:rgb(0,102,170);"><u>Xiaogang Xu</u></span> and <span style="color:rgb(0,102,170);"><u>Huijie Wang</u></span>. I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the School of Energy and Power Engineering at Inner Mongolia University of Technology (IMUT). During my studies, I served as a student assistant for one year at Jiangsu Fangtian Power Technology Co., Ltd.. Additionally, I worked for 2 years as a data analyst at Dazhongdianping, Micro Life Co., Ltd. <img src='./images/dzdp.png' style='width: 1.2em;'>.

My primary research focused on equipment fault diagnosis and condition monitoring based on signal processing techniques and deep learning algorithms. I have published 6Ô∏è‚É£ SCI papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gV5h0jMAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FZhixiaFan%2FZhixiaFan.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>, several of which were published in top international journals such as IEEE TII and Measurement, among, <span style="color:red;">**first author on 2 papers and corresponding author on 5 papers.**</span> Additionally, 3Ô∏è‚É£ more SCI first-author papers are currently under review.

I have participated in multiple engineering projects; Invited as a reviewer by multiple internationally renowned journals such as Information Fusion, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, Knowledge Based Systems, and Scientific Reports; I have attended numerous academic conferences and supervised several undergraduate thesis projects; To enhance my skills, I completed an algorithm training course in artificial intelligence.
